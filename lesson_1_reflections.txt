Q - How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Q - What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A - pros are that we have right to chose when we want to have a commit to be saved and cons is that it is a bit difficult to choose when to save a commit means after how many and what kind of changes do we have to make a commit.

Q - Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A - I think it should be only one file per commit because having different files in one commit makes difficult for beginner to understand.

Q - How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A - git log command in the repository folder can show up all the commit made so far and git diff commit1 commit2 can show the changes between the two commit easily.

Q - How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
